# Digital Business Card

This is my first project part of the HTML & CSS course taught by Per Harald Borgen.
In this course I learned how to make a short and simple Digital Business Card.
The day after completing it, and as an extra and optional challenge proposed by Per, I added custom colors and animation to the business card.
In addition, I decided to configure buttons that give the option to play music.
I achieved all this additional design with the help of the Internet like any modern good programmer.

## Additional features:
    box-shadow: [length]px [length]px #[color];
    cursor: [value];
    transition: [time]s; 
    font: [font-style] [font-variant] [font-weight] [font-size]px/[line-height]px [font-family]

    .selector:hover {}
